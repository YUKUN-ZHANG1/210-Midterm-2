Hi, dear Professor Dietrich.

Here are just some explanations, it would be great if you could read on.

First of all, I apologize for being late, as I was trying to fix the bug with reading arrays. the main branch you see now has the bug, and is also the version that was not late.

The fixed version is on the Yukun branch. I submitted it as a late lab, and fixed it by changing names array and name_size to const. I didn't have time to check it slowly, so I chose this simple but fast method. But that was the only change. Since the main logic of my code is fine, I hope the fixed version will give you more references for grading.
As well as I'm sorry I don't really have time to write comments.
