// COMSC-210 | Midterm #2 | Yukun Zhang
// IDE used: Visual Studio Code

//I'm used to opening a separate file to program the project, 
//rather than with the entire code of a class, which is more readable. 
//But since I don't have time to rewrite the header files, I'll just 
//include the .cpp file, which still works. Make sure the 210-midterm-starter.cpp 
//is in the same folder as the current file. And that210-midterm-starter.cppdoes not have a main.

#include <iostream>
